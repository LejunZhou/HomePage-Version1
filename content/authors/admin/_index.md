Here is Lejun Zhou. I have gotten my Bachelor Degrees in Cilvil Engineering from Zhejiang University (ZJU) and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). And I will go to UCB for MS degree study this August. My research intersets are dynamic network modeling and optimization, autonoumous vehicle system, and optimal transportation. I am optimistic about the future of intelligent transportation and logistics, and hope that my work will advance the development. In the next few years, I will continue to explore more about transportation engineering and operation research in graduate programs, welcome to discuss with me.
